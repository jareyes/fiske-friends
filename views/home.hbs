<h2 id="donate">Donate to the Friends</h2>
<p>
  The Friends raise money for library programs and services. Their contributions bridge a
  critical gap between municipal funding and philanthropic donations that make up the
  library's budget. Many of the programs and services that you love the most are sponsored
  by the Friends.
</p>
<p>Your donations directly support the Fiske Free Library and are tax-deductible.</p>
